# Commands
## System of Linear Equations
- `cond(A, inf)`: Computes the conditioning number for a system of linear
equations. The result refers to the maximum Error Magnification Factor `M`.
- `norm(A, inf)`: Calculates the norm of a vector or matrix.
- `A\B`: Solves a SOLE using the PA=LU decomposition method. NOTE: This includes
a relative error of ~10^-16.
- `[L, U, P] = lu(A)`: Performs the PA=LU decomposition. Returns the
Permutation, Upper, and Lower matrices.
